## Bias-Variance tradeoff

* `Variance` refers to the mount by which $\hat{f}$ would change if a different training dataset is used;
* `Bias` refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem.

## Linear Regression vs. Logistic Regression

### Linear function
$Y = β_0 + β_1X + ε$

### Logistic function
$p(X) = \frac{e^{{β_0}+{β_1}X}}{1 + e^{{β_0}+{β_1}X}}$

$\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} = e^{{β_0}+{β_1}X}$

$log(\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}) = β_0+β_1X$

### Estimation of Coefficients 

* Linear Regression uses least squares, Logistic Regression uses maximum likelihood
