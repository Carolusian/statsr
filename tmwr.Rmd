## My own overview 

- The basics chapters for this book: 1 - 9
  - easy to understand;
  - worth practice a lot
  - worth review multiple quickly for multiple times
- The advanced chapters for effective modeling: 10-14 
  - need deep understanding
  - worth read slowly in depth for multiple times
  - can be combined with ISLR and APM

## Feature Engineering with Recipies

- `recipes` package: **specification** of the steps for pre-processing
- a recipe object defines the steps without immediately executing them
- `all_nominal`: captures all columns which are factor or character in nature
- advantages: broader preprocessing choice; compact syntax; recycled for many models; decoupled; OOP as an object
- three phases: `recipe` -> `prep` (calculate statistics) -> `bake`
- `juice()` can be used to check the prep result in a dataframe
- interaction effect: involve two or more predictors, encoded as there product
- main effect: the original two predictors

## Fitting moodels with Parsnip

- `parsnip`: fluent and standardized interface for different models
- TODO

## A Model Workflow

- `workflow`: bind preprocessing and modeling objects together 
- TODO

## Judging model effectiveness

- `yardstick`: produce performance metrics with consistent interfaces
- `regression metrics` and `classification metrics`

## Resampling for evaluating performance

- `rsample`
- `tune`
