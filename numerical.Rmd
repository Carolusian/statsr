## Explain different numerical measures

### Quartile: 1st (lower), 2nd (median), 3rd (upper) quartiles

When the data is sorted in ascending order, quartiles are the values that cut of the first 25%, 50% and 70% of the data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
length(mtcars$mpg)
mpg <- sort(mtcars$mpg)

# calculate cut off positions
pos <- c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.1) * 32 + 1
pos

# calculate the quartiles manually
first_quartile <- mpg[9]
second_quartile <- mpg[17]  
third_quartile <- mpg[25]

c(first_quartile, second_quartile, third_quartile)

# use `quantile` function which sorts the data for you as well
quantile(mtcars$mpg)
sort(mtcars$mpg) %>% 
  quantile()
```

### Percentile
